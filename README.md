## Requirements:
A take home test designing an API interface for a fictitious company

Welcome to Brewhaus!

Please design a simple website for the fictitious company Brewhaus using the Punk API located here: https://punkapi.com/

Features of this website should include:
- Main page listing out beers
- Pagination or lazy loading of beers
- Simple search function of beers
- Details page where a user can find out more information about specific beers, such as IBUs, hops and malt type.

Feel free to embellish beyond that.

While you are not obligated to use them, this repo comes with an API file and a Brewhaus image. **You are free to use anything else you would like!**

Good luck!

## For running locally:

- Do `npm install`
- Run the command `npm start`
- Hit `http://localhost:3000/brewhaus`
